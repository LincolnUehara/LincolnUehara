### Hi! My name is Lincoln Uehara ^.~

I am embedded system engineer, and I have some skills on hardware, firmware and software layers. 

We can keep in touch on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LincolnUehara) or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lincoln-uehara/). =)

### Some works

* **2016-2017**: My bachelor thesis was about developing a ECG with Bluetooth connection using a [TI's Tiva board](https://www.ti.com/tool/EK-TM4C123GXL). You can read it in [Portuguese](https://repositorio.unesp.br/bitstream/handle/11449/155292/000881439.pdf) or [English](https://eventos.ufabc.edu.br/siimsps/files/id165.pdf).

* **2017-now**: I published some technical articles on Brazilian website called [Embarcados](https://www.embarcados.com.br/), you can see my list [here](https://www.embarcados.com.br/autor/evertonuehara/).

* **2018**: A [Story Line Game](https://github.com/LincolnUehara/storylineGame) for a presentation on Campus Party 2017. It was a workshop to teach git commands through storytelling.

* **2019**: [Voting system for parties](https://github.com/LincolnUehara/dc-voting) using a landing page on a Raspberry Pi Zero. It was a presentation (in Portuguese) on my alma mater to show how different programming languages you can use on a project and even choose for your career path.

* **2020**: [PCB Portrait](https://www.hackster.io/lin_hara/pcb-portrait-aquarius-eca035). It was a little present from me to a friend, and a challenge for me to design a professional and artistical PCB. You can checkout the making of video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2W8A3zgU_Mk).

* **2020**: A [Touchless/Contactless frame](https://www.hackster.io/lin_hara/touchless-frame-fd138e) for ["Touch Less, Do More
with Arduino" Contest](https://www.hackster.io/contests/touchlessdomore) by Hackster.io.
